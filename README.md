# setup
new computer setup

The basics of this repo are that it
1. installs some key system packages I generally need for a machine.
2. installs some fonts that make my life better
3. sets up iterm2 to be more sane
4. sets up zsh to be more sane

## Usage
Basically just execute each file 1 at a time and make sure it all installs.

## Caveats

[Vim config](https://github.com/justinbburris/nvim-config) stored elsewhere

Currently only really works for os x but I'm sure it could be improved generally.
